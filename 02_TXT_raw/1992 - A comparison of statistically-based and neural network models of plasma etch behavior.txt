Among these are recipe  generation and optimization [2], statistical process con trol 131, and equipment malfunction diagnosis [4]. In  recent years, the technique of ion-assisted plasma etch ing has become widely used in semiconductor manufac turing. Due to this increased popularity, considerable  effort has been expended in developing reliable methods  of process characterization for this complex physical  and chemical process.  Characterization is aimed at  modeling the response of process outputs to vadations  in input parameters with a very high degree of preci sion.

Although simulation is useful for equipment  design and optimization, it is subject to many simplify ing assumptions, and the true connection between these  microscopic models and macroscopic parameters (such  as etch rate) has yet to be clearly distinguished.  Since the complexity of practical plasma processes  at the equipment level is presently ahead of theoretical  comprehension, other efforts have focused on empirical  approaches to plasma modeling involving Response  Surface Methods (RSM) [IO]. Models derived via  RSM accurately represent the behavior of a specific  piece of equipment under a wide range of etch recipes,  thus making them very useful for manufacturing pur poses. More recently, however, an adaptive learning  technique which utilizes neural networks and influence  diagrams in conjunction with statistical methods has  been applied to the modeling of polysilicon growth by  low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) [ 11.  In that study, the neural process models were shown to  exhibit less experimental error than their statistical  counterparts, even when created from less experimental  data.  In this paper, two different neural network model ing methodologies are applied to the removal of polysil icon films by plasma etching. In one case, a neural  modeling algorithm is implemented via a C program,  while in the second case, neural process models are  developed using the commercially available Brainmaker  software package [Ill. A recent RSM study focused  on modeling the etch characteristics of n+-doped  polysilicon in a CClfie/02 plasma [7]. Etch rate, uni formity, and selectivity to both silicon dioxide and pho toresist were modeled as a function of six input param eters: RF power, pressure, electrode spacing, and the  three gas flows. Etching took place in a Lam Research  Autoetch 490 single-wafer plasma system. In comparing  the RSM models derived from these experiments the  neural models, it is determined that the neural models  exhibit superior accuracy to the RSM models and  require fewer training experiments. In fact, the results  of this study indicate that the predictive capabilities of  the neural net models are superior to that of their sta tistical counterparts for the same experimental data.'}

{'page': 3, 'text': '4.0 Process Modeling With Neural Networks  Neural networks have previously demonstrated the  capability of learning complex relationships between  groups of related parameters [1,14-161. Such learning  abilities are attributed to the fact that neural networks,  possessing many simple parallel processing units (called  neurons or neurodes), crudely resemble the architecture  of the human brain. These rudimentary processors are  interconnected in such a way that knowledge is stored  in the weight of the connections between them. Each  neuron contains the weighted sum of its inputs filtered  by a exponential "squashing" function, thereby endow ing neural networks with the ability to generalize with  an added degree of freedom not available in statistical  regression techniques.  In order to model complex manufacturing processes  such as the plasma etching example above, the quantita tive relationships which relate the six input parameters  are learned via the feed-forward error back-propagation  (FFEBP) algorithm. This algorithm has been shown to  be very effective in learning arbitrary nonlinear map pings between noisy sets of input and output vectors  [16]. Networks consist of one or more layers of neu rons which receive, process, and transmit critical infor mation regarding the relationships between the input  parameters and corresponding responses. FFEBP net works incorporate "hidden" layers of neurons which do  not interact with the outside world, but perform  classification and feature extraction tasks on information  provided by the input and output layers.'}

In the plasma etch application, the input  layer of neurons receives external information and  corresponds to the six adjustable input parameters. The  output layer transmits information to the outside world,  and thus corresponds to the process responses (etch  rate, uniformity, etc.). The number of hidden layer neu rons is varied to achieve maximum performance. A  neural network with a structure consisting of six input  neurons, six hidden neurons and four output neurons is  referred to as a "6-6-4" structure.  ? 2 B P P Input'}

{'page': 3, 'text': 'In the FFEBP modeling algorithm, the network  begins with a random set of weights. An input vector  is then presented to the network and the output is CGICU lated using this initial weight matrix. Next, the calcu lated output is compared to the measured output data,  and the squared difference between these two vectors  determines the system error. The accumulated error for  all the input-output pairs is the Euclidean distance in  the weight space which the network attempts to minim ize. Minimization is accomplished via the gradient des cent approach, in which the system is adjusted in the  direction of decreasing error [15].  Increasing the  number of hidden neurons or hidden layers in the net work helps this minimization process to converge. It  has been shown that FFEBP networks can encode any  arbitrary input-output relationship with a maximum of  two hidden layers [15-161.  In this study, the above algorithm has been imple mented via a C program as well as by using the com mercially available Brainmaker software [ 1 13. In each  case, the network is trained on a subset of the available  experimental data which spans the ranges of interest  and subsequently tested on other remaining data. Train ing is assumed to be complete when all outputs are  within a previously defined tolerance of the training  data.

Brainmaker also utilizes  the FFEBP algorithm. One difference is that in Bruin maker, the error in the output of each neuron is allowed  to vary within a user-defined range known as the train ing tolerance.
